    <head1>New preview release</head1>
    <txt>A preview to release 2.2 of <s /> is available.  This release contains a new array decision procedure which is designed to enable quantifier-free interpolation.  The interpolation procedure however is not yet implemented.  Additionally we changed the model generation such that we now produce anonymous terms of the form (as @0 S) for a sort S.  The array model basically are a difference map to an array (as @0 (Array TI TE)) that contains at every index the value (as @0 TE).  Note that in the current version of our array solver the index type Bool is not supported.</txt>

    <head1>New minor release</head1>
    <txt>Release 2.1 of <s /> is available.  Among some bug fixes this release includes support for user cancellation requests.  While <s /> is performing a satisfiability check it now regularly polls a cancellation request that can be configured via the API.</txt>
    <head1>New release</head1>
    <txt>A new release is available.  This release fixes a bug in the tree interpolation engine and provides SMTLIB 2 compliant models for IRA logics.</txt>
    <head1>New bugfix release</head1>
    <txt>A new release of <s /> is available. It now allows users to define functions that take arguments in QF_LIA and QF_LRA. Thanks to Hans-Martin Adorf for reporting this bug.</txt>

    <head1>Proof Transformations</head1>
    <txt>The latest version of <s /> incorporates the proof tree transformation techniques presented by Fontaine et. al. in their paper <link url="http://www.loria.fr/~fontaine/Fontaine14.pdf">Compression of Propositional Resolution Proofs via Partial Regularization"</link>.  The option <tt>:proof-transformation</tt> can be used to activate one of the algorithms presented in this paper.  Possible values are:
    <table>

	<col>No transformation (default)</col>
      </row>
      <row>
	<col><tt>LU</tt></col>
	<col>Lower all unit resolutions such that every unit is resolved only once in the whole proof tree.</col>

	<col>Recycle pivots by partial regularization.</col>

    <head1>License Change</head1>
    <txt>On popular demand we changed the license of <s /> from
    GPL to LGPL.</txt> <head1>SMT Competition 2011</head1> <txt>A pre-release
    version of <s /> 2.0 participated in the <link
    url="http://www.smtcomp.org/2011/">SMT-COMP 2011</link> in the <link
    url="http://www.smtexec.org/exec/?jobs=856">main</link> and in the <link
    url="http://www.smtexec.org/exec/?jobs=859">application</link> track.  See
    these pages for further details. This was the first time <s />
    participated in the competition. It showed its strength in the divisions
    QF_UFLRA and QF_UFLIA where it could solve as many instances as the winner
    of this division in the main track.</txt>
